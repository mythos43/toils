# Toils -- A Time tracking and invoicing application for freelancers

![Toils App](/images/toils_gui.png)

Toils is written in Python and GTK+. It uses a SQLite database in the backend.

# Motivation

When I worked as a freelancer, I could not find a simple time tracker that fit my needs so I decided to make my own. Toils measures the amount of time you spend working for each client and can create PDF invoices when you're ready to bill your clients.

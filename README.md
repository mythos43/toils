# Toils -- A Time tracking and invoicing application for freelancers

![Toils App](/images/toils_gui.png)

Toils is written in Python and GTK+. It uses a SQLite database in the backend. This project is a work in progress.

# Motivation

When I worked as a freelancer, I could not find a simple time tracker that fit my needs so I decided to make my own. Toils measures the amount of time you spend working for each client and can create PDF invoices when you're ready to bill your clients.

# Requirements
Toils requires a Python 3 installation and the GTK+ toolkit.The dependencies you need to install will vary based on your Operating System. Most Linux distributions should be able to run toils without installing anything. For other platforms, you need to get the following:

+ gi
+ pygobject
+ pycairo
